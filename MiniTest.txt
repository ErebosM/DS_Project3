3. It happens before. If you do it afterwards it's possible that another message arrives before the clock is incremented and that can result in an inconsistent state.


5.	Vector clocks are designed under the assumtion that there is an constant amount of processes and you have to know the number of processes in advantage.
	Today, in most distributed applications you need vector clocks which can grow dynamicly. In the paper they proposed dynamic vector clock which can overcome these disadvantages.
